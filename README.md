# 👋 Hi, I'm Cristian Voltan

I am a **Control Systems Engineering** student at the **University of Padova (UniPD)**.

This GitHub profile collects some of the projects developed during my Master's degree. The repositories include academic projects, simulations, software implementations, and practical applications of control engineering concepts.

## 📂 Projects
Each repository contains code, documentation, and, when available, simulation results related to coursework and projects completed during the Master's program.
